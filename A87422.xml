            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>IF this of mine should appear any way displeasing to one particular person (though I hope the contrary;) truly it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thus, When I left the Army, I found that I could not close with any single interest in <hi>England,</hi> but that I should more earnestly contend for Peace, then might be pleasing to some powerful Persons; did therfore intend to depart the Kingdom, and of 1200 l. arrears, I endeavoured but for 2. or 300 l. at most for my self, and 100 l. amongst some old Soldiers (which at my first engageing, I brought from their trades, and therefore bound in conscience to consider that their great losse) acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the rest: but was so far from obtaining it, that although I have highly endeavored ever since for the auditeing of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, (and satisfying the Auditory with all things in order
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115029:2"/>thereunto, at the first of their demands; yet since have it cost me more then 150 l. and 12 months attending &amp; cannot obtain a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch therein, although it would not have required the time of half a day to have compleated them.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, when first I engaged in the <hi>Parliaments</hi> war, I had bin long deeply sensible of the many greevous Incroachments and Usurpations excercised over the People of this Nation: and therefore in <hi>Apr.</hi> 1643. in conscience and judgement I drew forth my sword for the recovery of my Countries Rights &amp; Freedom; and continued engaged both before and in all the war of the Earl of <hi>Manchesters</hi> Army, and since with you, in my Lord Generals Army that now is, untill <hi>April</hi> 1648. in which time (although through many weaknesses) I neither coveted Honour or Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but a happy Peace: and notwithstanding as great opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of inriching my self, as I conceive most men have had, yet can I rejoyce in nothing but in my continued Zeale to my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries good; as also of my Poverty: But when I certainly discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Resolutions to grounds and foundations of a lasting War, even unto a conquest of one side unto the 3 Nations; and the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness to mislead and make bitter the purest waters, I thereat laid down my sword; and the sad thing then appearing, pretious Mr <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> his life, Mr <hi>Penell,</hi> Mr <hi>Dell</hi> and others left the Army. But knowing that man is made, reasonable to admire the Creator, and to command his senses to all proper actions of moderation through faith in the like pretious Grace of Christ, for publique preservation thereto. According to this my knowledge in all singleness of Spirit, I greatly laboured to beget a good understanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the City and you; And considering your often published great dislike that any single interest should be set up in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as also, your high detestation of long sitting <hi>Parliaments;</hi> with observation of what else was conceived you (as well as they) aymed at, for freedom to the People; And not only for the averting of that Woe and destruction by blood and Famine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mankind, which Wars cannot wave, but for the avoiding the barbarous slavery which the Sword doth ever usher in (though under the higest pretences of Liberty (perhaps for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years together before surely effected) as also for a firm and lasting Peace: with consideration of the long and chargeable War before our subduing of <hi>Jreland,</hi> besides our (almost) utter
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115029:2"/>devastation and ruine thereof: our long contest and wars with <hi>Scotland,</hi> even for some hundered of years together; the great poverty of them all in those days: as also that since the Union by King <hi>James,</hi> their Revenue, Trade and Treasure, was increased before these wars, more then sour-fold. And knowing that <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and this Nation, being both conteined in one Island, and <hi>Jreland</hi> lying as it doth; that a wound, or the least distemper in one, must needs be a prick in each of the others sides; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were throughly sencible of the King and Lords In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments and Usurpations upon their freedom to the great inslaving of them, and wherefore, at the begining of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> they first opposed their Tirannie (above others,) yet for the Considerations aforesaid, and that nothing is evil but in the abuse, nor that names mattereth but things: That the Heart of man is deceitful above all; and that if a great Steerer in State, of sometimes a pious, Christian, and holy life, shall by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, through multiplicity of business, be robbed thereof; yet if in reputation, how easie is it for such a Leader by his false light to put out the true candle of sincerity in most of the godly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that it shines upon, Aye, and to draw the Stars of most hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Light unto the earth again, (if poverty, or the least earthly thoughts of honor possess them, when the Earth, Honor and Riches be at his dispose,) Therefore for the avoiding of grounds of War, and to keep the tyes and bonds of approved prosperous national Peace, as also to hinder the setting up of any particular person, that by his interest might make himself still more abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, whether under the name of Commoner, King, Emperor or Captain-General, and for the obtainment of free and frequent Parliaments, according to the old unamendable Constitution; as for the continuance of some truth amongst us, that all the cords of Love and Government might not be wholly dissolved, did also in the way of God, according to the Gospel of Christ, and Rule of Peace, for maintenance of propriety, and an equal Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to all men, (and for binding their Kings with chains, and their Nobles with links of iron, (yet of the most noble and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant nature), as also for the advancement of piety, true vertue, and the abatement of vice, (which they conceived would not be rejected by you,) drew up the substance of this insuing paper, which is conceived to savor of nothing but Equity and Mercy, for the real Conjunction of all interests, so as the greatest restraint
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115029:3"/>upon the Cavaliers is but a debarment of sitting in the two next Parliaments Voyces in the Elections thereof, and joyning in any publique Petition thereto during that time; yet looking to means of Safety, Maintenance of Goodness, and hinderance of all means of Excess in evil, knowing the moderation of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and good light therein; as also how greatly God hath honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you with success, in subduing of an excessive people, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desired the chief Command to continue in your hands, as well in <hi>Ireland</hi> as <hi>England,</hi> as appears in the Paper. And truly, upon such terms as I am ready to maintain, That if you had both Nations at your dispose, maintaining Propriety, you could not have more ways of Honor, Riches, and Greatness, then is there laid down, (and with a greater certainty of holding the same, then by a Conquest,) but where the thing is not truly examined, it cannot be understood, and knowing your former candor and integrity to the Publique Cause of Christ, (Peace &amp; Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.) I went down with the Paper to <hi>Colchester,</hi> and by a very worthy Member of Honor, with you, caused it to be presented not only to all the General Officers then there, his Excellency excepted, but to Col. <hi>Rainsbrough,</hi> and the rest of the other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, and many other worthy Officers also, and whose willing and free approbation it then had, &amp; was carryed to Commissiary Gen. <hi>Ireton,</hi> who was then at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> by a very noble Colonel, for his approbation also: But, as I was informed, with him it stuck, and went no further. Then when his Excellency came to St <hi>Albanes</hi> I shewed it to him, whose worthy acceptance it there received, (as from him not a little inclineable to peace,) with answer, That it should not want his further Consideration; after that I shewed it to Col. <hi>Harrison,</hi> who advised me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute it also; then after to several others of your Members of much quality; and for that it was so greatly desired, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no check, (either from Officer, or any other Independent; or Leveller that ever saw it,) but in its rest with Commissary Gen. <hi>Ireton,</hi> (as I was informed:) The Citizens did therefore (again, when it was yet more full then before) endeavor for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries approbation; and at the Armies first coming to <hi>London</hi> presented it to him for his acceptance, and that from him it might be presented to the Armies view for the Concurrence thereof; but he was pleased to cause answer to be returned, that it was then too late: But after the death of the King, when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115029:3"/>I expected Righteousness, and immediately beheld as great ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and injustice as before. And considering that in your Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you made no Bar against a kingly Government, &amp; as it hath been often said amongst many of you, as it is true, this <hi>Parliament</hi> can bind no further then until the next, and that they may then choose a King, and thus finding no bottom; and for that it is not possible, but every Christian, whose nature is stability, will look at a Foundation, and the most certain Rule whereupon to build up Peace and Righteousness, the Fruit of Christ, (before a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency for favor and honor sake of the will of the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful person on earth,) was led out in spirit to deliver the Paper (little differing from what it now appears) unto a Gentleman to be viewed by a noble powerful person amongst you, before I took notice of the <hi>Parliaments Commands</hi> to the contrary; which being ill taken by some, and mis-represented by others: I am now humbly bold for avoyding your prejudice of me, to represent it to your view to judg of the thing, whereby I doubt not but to be excused by you (whom I so greatly honor) as to the honesty thereof; but crave your wavement of my ignorance of the <hi>Parliaments Command</hi> to the contrary.</p>
               <p>And Gentlemen, whereas knowing your own houshold is so greatly divided, that one party chargeth the other for <hi>Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliaen Atheists, Jesuites, &amp;c.</hi> and they the other party for <hi>Machiviliaen Designers</hi> by the <hi>Law, Prophets and Gospel,</hi> so as indeed unless your end (which may be some years of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hence, if nothing but the Sword must deside the differences) accomplish not a better thing then as is charged, witnessed and proclaimed to the world, even by your own Members: You may have the fame of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Tyrant, but never of Christ; and if as is said amongst you, that many of you do through exceeding fear for hindering your Honor, and just advancement, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of some persons, do act by the eye and hints, (by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of what is most agreeable to the mind of some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular persons,) more then clearly to what your judgment stands, and conscience leads you; then, if so, considering the supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority so lately taken in, and still is compast by your Sword, what are the people now, or hereafter like to be? Upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious consideration whereof I do for the Honor of God, the Nation, and your Peace, Honor and Freedom, as also for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding of the sad reports which passeth upon some of the most
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115029:4"/>honorable persons with you, (for the effecting of a bad design by that means, and conceiving the least overbearings in your Councels, as things standeth, may right-wel tend to great nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al evils,) I humbly offer this Expedient, (if his Excellency will be pleased to assent,) that a gradual advancement may be approved on amongst you according to succession, and that if any be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thereof, that they may be timely questioned and dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, according to Reason, and Discipline of War: But that above all, your Votes may be always taken from the least to the highest Questions in all your Councels, by balls and a ballading box for that purpose, which certain will take off those aspertions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair your honor, and lay that dissatisfaction amongst you, (which fear or favour cannot do.)</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, Truly I did not fight for the fame of <hi>Alexander,</hi> but Christ; and can it be imagined, that if a real spirited Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian were now in so great power with us, as to be able to say, as this day such a people shall not be the <hi>supream Authority of the Nation,</hi> but I will draw my sword against him that shall call them so; but the next day, the best face of Authority, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after to own them for the supream Authority, and then to be put out of question; as also afterwards to say, this thing is just, therefore let it not be referred to the supream Authority, but let us (this <hi>Councel</hi>) have the honor of it. Might not such a one, by casting off sensuality, and walking by the true spirit of Christ, produce a new Heavens and a new Earth, wherein Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness dwells, his personal reign. Consider what <hi>Leaders</hi> of Nations, Imitation and Custom will do, If I had been born a <hi>Cannibal,</hi> or <hi>Indian</hi> of any other condition, I had been the same; If a <hi>Turk,</hi> a <hi>Turk;</hi> If an Idolatrous <hi>Spaniard,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard:</hi> It is true, God is good unto all but in different manners, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the means of Grace. If I had never heard, I had never spoken, nor yet obtained faith in the grace of Christ: And it is possible for <hi>Leaders in Nations,</hi> even by their walking, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie or poyson as deep as they please. I shall not speak of the grounds and ways for an assurance of distressed recruits for your Army, or how they will be kept poore and servile for any thing, nor of the unmatchable ways (as of Christian humility) to carry on the high thing; as also the insensible means to elevate and steal away the humble hearts of the godly Officers for that purpose. And truly, I witness it of God, there is such a fault amongst
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115029:4"/>some few of you, as my pen shakes to record the particulars of my Observation (though unto my self;) and certain it is policy of God that when you finde the great Steerers in State to be corrupt, though but a little, to endeavor an accommodation, and to meet with others interests (if) in a firm way; for you can draw none unto you, unless you exceed others in Justice. And it was desired to be shewn, in a Paper entituled <hi>A plea for mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the Armies Transactions,</hi> what the largest hearted Christian of any party would have more layd down for an equal enjoyment of Peace and Freedom unto all, then was layd down in the Citizens paper. And let my boldness pass (until upon sure grounds there be cause of reproof) if I say, that on <hi>This</hi> and <hi>This</hi> only resteth our Freedom, <hi>viz.</hi> That now our Freedom is known, that we have free and frequent Parliaments, and Peace to put it in execution; for perhaps an honest man (as a rare creature) may act honest things five or six moneths for Gods sake, if a dishonest man for popularity sake, or else for fear of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan Account to the People, as also their present opportunity to rectifie the thing unjustly acted, and question the actor; And thus neither dishonest or honest men can make the least breach in our Freedom; whereas long vacations of Parliaments and long Sessions do both produce necessitated ignorance by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitraryness of the one, and want of opportunity, and means to question usurpations and incroachments of slavery by the other. But where civil Wars are, there can be no firm, but unconstant Actings, according to success, as others can witness, more feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, then your selves. It is also considerable that this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should have bin set on foot by one of the late most famous Cities in the world, out of Arms, which in Reason would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven grounds of Peace and not of Wars. Gentlemen, I had a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Call amongst you, whereby that was done by me, that commands this my publique dealing with you, lest I should count my self a mercinary beast and a murtherer: and the same spirit that did keep me free from mercinary ends then, is still the same unto me, and I hope will ever command my pen to write the truth, though to the loss of Arrears, favor of any, or the greatest advancement, nay life and all: and although I am not a <hi>Leveller,</hi> but as you see, or am of those Gentlemens Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels that were lately committed, (nor know I the cause thereof, for that I yet never read their book) yet let me tell you, That
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115029:5"/>he that is a true Christian doth expect plain dealing with you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others; and I must witness it on the behalf of God, you have and do give cause of just exception against much of what you have done and said. I shall not question or speak any thing of your imprisoning some of the Members of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and secluding the rest; but certain it was for much evil, or else I hope it would not have been done; but if so, then to the future nothing but righteousness is expected from you, and if you hold forth good things, and put them not in execution at your time and season promised, here is a breach of truth; and truly he that is not a beast will question the meaning of it: not did it sound pleasingly to my ears to hear an honorable person of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of State tell me of necessitated thoughts of adjourning the <hi>Parliament</hi> for some moneths, and then to recruit this <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> with new Members in the room of those now secluded and imprisoned: And again I am informed, that there is a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with you, of much greatness, that saith himself is deeply troubled to see the <hi>Parliament</hi> to act as they do; but why should that Gentleman blame them? Can it be imagined that when first your Army purged the house, that there were more Members left then were conceived assuredly real to the Armies interest; it is true, the deepest <hi>Leader</hi> in State will ever have one to co-operate with him; so as in case an interest divide, one may speak the language of one, and the other of the other, to save stakes; as also to have some that must bear their blame, if things frame not according to designe. But truly Gentlemen, if I did think (as perhaps there may be some that do, that after death comes nothing but Fame (though not among you); and that I would act wholy for Fame-sake yet would I take the way of Truth, and plain dealing: which certain is able to confound all the Machiavilians in the world; nor would I hold forth such things as I intend not to perform, for that is <hi>Machiavils</hi> policy to lay down the best things (but when they will not make for his design) at such times, and at such seasons, or in such ways as they shall not be performed: yet he will save his credit by it (oft times even for a long time together:) But my prayer shall ever be that you will alwayes hold fast the true Spirit and Graces of Christ, Iustice, Mercy, Love, Truth, and Humility, and to finish the bond of Peace to your eternall Honor, and everlasting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AFter the printing of the two first Sheets, I considering that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the reall intent of my spirit in publishing thereof be for no other end, but for your externall and internall greatest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, blisse and prosperity; yet in reguard of my boldnesse with you if (perhaps) a bad construction should be put thereon, it might be taken ill, made a stop thereof; but in consideration of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of my heart, and that I intend the lessening of no mans ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or command but some timely cautions for repairing thereof; And upon consideration that all pious, wisemen will prize and weigh the caution, corrasive and reproof of a reall Friend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Supallitie wickedness and destroying vanity of dissembling flatterers, Especially of me that so innocently and inoffensively left you after five years engagement with very many of you, and that nothing was ever so burdensome unto me as the losse of your most precious socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and because my hearts desire is, that it may be with you as in the times of the Gospel, and that you may not be beclouded under one (of <hi>Moses</hi> vails, &amp; have as little rest as the children of Israel had, and one of their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths in stead of a Sabbath of Christ, and a day of Jubile and peace,) am therefore bold to advise unto the work of Moderation, where the Lord is ever at hand. Nor am I ashamed to tell you, that so great was my cause (at the discovery of those grounds of misery unto the Nations, touching the particular whereof I shall be silent) when first I was pressed to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thoughts of laying down my Commission, that the Heavens and Earth were shaken in me, and I was forc'd to inquire again what God was; and by my observation of the orderly motion of the glorious Bodies of the Sun, Moon, Earth and Stars, do know, that something put (and keeps) them in order; which infinite Thing is to day and for ever the life motion and being of all things, but all in order; and as this God did, so he doth create all things good and nothing evill; the L'fties and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115029:10"/>plants live, and differeth in beauty and vertue: Beasts live, and have sense, the nature where of simply seeketh it self; and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing given to excesse, greatly raveneth, and devoureth each other. But Man is endued not onely with life and sense (and therein no better then a beast) but with at high and glorious superlative faculty of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, called <hi>Reason;</hi> the nature whereof is to admire him that is not onely Life, Sense and Reason, (which are all in their right use admirably good) but incomprehensibly greater, and that creates all things so good, that no man knows the vertue (as sentially it may be spoken) of the least or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest of things, or can annihilate the least more or hair: nor is there any thing of Reason, but that onely which tends to admiration, with the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof which naturally flow from thence for a holy and sober use of all things; but above all, for freedom and preservation of man (who only is capable thereof) to admire the Lord of life and glory. As he that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth much (which every thing our eys see, our ears hear, and we have occasion to), loveth much; nor can any one destroy, or make any improper use of the thing he rightly loves: and all evil is unto the creature onely, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by excesse, and the improper use of things, contrary to the wisdom and truth of the Father by agreement among the sons of men, as doth all good by the moderate and proper use of things, (God being infinite, immutable, and changeth not, the change being onely unto man). Wherefore, if I have Reason given me to command my Senses to all proper actions of modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which yet is stifled by the leading Beasts (and mystery of iniquity) of the earth, that subjects the high knowledge, discoursive, and glorious communicative facultie of the soul unto the lust of their senses (as all men unto their wils) which then ceaseth to be Reason, and is but Serpents wit) for the preservation of the Creation, it is proper that I imploy it to the same; but above all man, the glory thereof, and would every one know and consider, that whatsoever is of Reason, is above Sense, and seeketh not it self but in each others good, and would do it also, (which every man can as certainly do as number.) This plain thing is that high thing spoken of by Christ, that would produce a new heaven and a new earth, wherein righteousnesse dwels (and for want of which all men are judging, and shall be judged;) and also is it that knowledge which shall cover the Earth, as water doth the Seas, and that which shall produce the personall reigne of Christ: and this onely is his Spirit, the losse of the first <hi>Adam</hi> made good by the second, and thus by the Fathers goodness was brought unto the true Son. And when hrough Reason, by Faith in the practice of his graces we have subdued the senses unto this frame we are not onely dead with him as to sensuality; but are risen with him (the words are <hi>[are risen with him]</hi>) to newnesse of life; not onely here but shall by a change unto everlasting. This is that, freedom where with he hath made us free, and such onely are free indeed, and by faith, in whose merits we are saved; the words are <hi>[are saved.]</hi> This day salvation is come unto thy house, the words are <hi>[is come;]</hi> and this is the way to faith, when by reading and hearing of the report of the graces of Christ, I examine
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115029:10"/>the difference between truth and falshood, between love and envie, between contention and peace, as doe I lay an opposite to every other grace, and upon comparing the one with the other, I finde nothing but joy and blessedness in the one, and horror and dissatisfaction in the other, &amp;c. And being in love with the gain of the one, and hating the dammage of the other, I may right well in reason assure my self, to command my senses by reason, to that which will bring moderation, (righteousnesse and peace which is better then to suffer my senses to captivate Reason, &amp; be perplexed in excess; thus have I faith &amp; assurance of overcoming my Senses, &amp; to capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate them unto that sweet frame of spirit in Christ: And when I can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire God in love, and rejoycing herein, &amp; that I can do as I would be done unto, I am saved, Salvation is come unto my house through Faith: And it was not by his hangîng upon the Crosse onely, for that was but one suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his love amongst millions, to teach us to be valiant in protesting against that beast of Excess, (and destroyers of man (to the hinderance of admiration) with a moderate and holy Contention unto death, and dye with love to righteousness (as Mr. <hi>Saltmarsh</hi> did, (a blessed change) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing against the flitting favor and honor of the greatest of men, abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to become implicite members of the Serpents-Tayl, to sting the rest of the silly beasts of the mountains unto death.</p>
            <p>I say again, that God did and doth create all things good, and nothing evil; and because the Scriptures, if rightly understood, tendeth onely unto this, <hi>viz.</hi> to instruction unto moderation in the proper (sober and holy) use of all things according to the truth of Agreement, by the wisdome of God in man, for the most free, peaceable and blessed well-being of man to admire the Creator, that is, (at this and every season) the life, motion and being of all things) I know them to be true, and Christ saith, to love God above all, our neighbour as our selves, and doe unto all as we would they should doe unto us; on this dependeth the Law and the Prophets; so as here all the wisdom, good counsell and holy matter contained in the Law and the Prophets, are summed up and brought to a little room, and unto a certain end; and it was the infinite goodness of the Father in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such a wise and holy Son as Christ, to shew the weakness, unvail and take off the hard servitude of man under the Law, yoke and cloud of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, and inlighten the blinde. And as all the slavery in the Christian world hath come by the Sword, and mysterious Cheat of the heads of the Schools (vented in the Pulpits) by combining with the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian policies of the ambitious Rulers thereof: For Christ rightly preached, bringeth nothing but externall, as well as internall freedom and peace; and although the holy Epistles of <hi>John</hi> were questioned by <hi>Calvin,</hi> yet may they and the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> also remain worthy of great esteem, (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that that, and all the rest be brought to the end aforesaid) as may the Schools and (Publique meeting-places in like manner) with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and honor also.</p>
            <p>And the most precious Christians ought not alwayes to refrain, nor at all to except against them, for this reason. The more publique the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115029:11"/>the more persons of Excess are there, whose (holy pious) and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate carriage they then behold, and are convinced thereby, and glorifie God by such their good light: And unless my grounds may be destroyed, this will follow, That whatsoever is most communicatively good for peace and righteousness unto all, is to be imbraced by all; wherefore to Admire God in the graces of Christ, is the highest good; for all such live above the beggerly Elements of the world in pure reason, reigning over and commanding the senses to serve it; and if a number of men wil agree together to have meetings, to the end to build up one another in pure reason, and that some will for a season agree to fit some to stand, and some to kneel, &amp;c. all which Christ did: this mattereth not; but if any by any form, or other meanes, say themselves to be more righteous then others, here is ambition in him to the depravement of others, and through this Excess comes contention, not peace, the end of such meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And as a large piece of Evidence containeth a small thing, and that a line or two beares the strength of the matter; so Christ sum'd up the force of the Scriptures in a line or two, nor put he any other yoke upon us, but a precious and sweet yoke and commandement of love, to tye us together in a heavenly peace, and to avoid destruction of one another. And should not I regard what the blessed history of the Scriptures saith of him, if I were not ravisht with the report of his graces, and which heavenly report wholly tendeth to moderation in the proper (and holy) use of all things, whereby I have faith in him through those his merits, (for Faith comes by hearing) of his report) which tends not only to particular salvation, but generall preservation of man to admire the Father in such a Sonne (before his particular workes of wonder:) And least I should be led away with Fancy in stead of true faith, as sometimes I have been, I shall desire to exchange a sheet a week with any true Christian spirited man touching these grounds, which if any can destroy, I hope to rejoice in it, by learning bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And as all Ordinances of prayer, preaching, &amp;c. are nothing unto God, but as they make us better by a sweet communion of love, adorn'd with Charity, the Bond of perfection, (observe another deep binding word, The <hi>[Bond]</hi> of perfection) but otherwise are cloaks of Iniquity, for the members of that mystery, so is he not to be owned for a Christian that dares do or speak any unjust thing premeditately: And as all man's imperfections are perfections in God, (for saith he) Is there any evil in the City and I have not done it?) wherefore every man may properly be called a godly man, but not a godly man in Christ, and all Christians are to be known by be squaring their lives to all proper actions of moderation, (Justice, Mercy, Truth, Love, Patience, Meekness, Freedom and Peace) not seeking his own, but in each others good. I shall give you here part of a Story of a godly man as to knowledge (out of Christ) in whom God was honored by scourging of a people for Idolizing man.</p>

               <hi>Andromachus</hi> of Greece aspired, outed, and carried the Empire from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexus</hi> through his frequent weeping for the unjust, and cruel yoak of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115029:11"/>inflicted upon the people by him, by which means he bereaved the people so far, as he obtained a great and powerfull party; to whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the most glorious freedom that ever was, and sealed those his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, with abundant of tears, and became not onely like minded to the depth of every ones passion to mourn with them that mourned, to be merry with those that were merry, but would ever wear sheeps cloathing, rejected Oratory, and was exceeding plain in words, and of much affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and seemingly the humblest of men, and would ever act in a crowd in the name of those his first begotten party, where he cherish'd the most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and faithfull, though of what manner of faith or zeal to God ward soever, so as they would lock up their works in obedience to his commands, well knowing, that men the more blindly zealous for God (by hopes of salvation through faith onely) they be, will also be the more greedy of destruction to others of another Faith, if rendred much opposite to theirs: That zeal employs the whole man, and that a few sober and zealous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons would do more service then many thousands of others: Could thus cry down, and be ready to destroy the most righteous men whatsoever (disobeying him.) And when first he opposed <hi>Alexus,</hi> he onely seemingly opposed his tyranny, and him as a Tyrant: It then not being born to speak of the taking away of the man, or the name of that Office, but then seasonably he gave occasion to one young party in his powerfull interest that were most earnest against the tyranny of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, to be jealous of him and his Compeer, as to intentions of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much favor towards the Emperour, but then which party grew much more bitter against the Emperor, as the more jealous against <hi>Andromachus</hi> also; so as at last they would not bear the name of Emperor, but would have a free State; to which <hi>Andromachus</hi> rejoycingly ingaged with many tears of sincerity to perform: but after <hi>Alexus</hi> was outed, <hi>Andromachus</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the Nobility too highly, that party (which increased) began to be more jealous of him, lest his intentions should not be the same that he pretended touching the freedom of the Common-wealth; and not onely by it, but because he had often vented singular expressions, as if he onely were able to kill or make alive, They then began to question his carriage of things. He then also endeavours to deal as hardly by them as formerly by <hi>Alexus</hi> his party, and to root out and destroy them that above men had been most faithfull to him, first putting them under the most odious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters to hinder honest men from examining Truth: and when he had gained so much power, that he made such and so many people as he pleased to be a supreme Authority of the Nation, after what way and manner as best pleased him, he then began to carry it so high amongst his first most powerful <hi>party,</hi> that if any honest man should but look or speak against what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he pleased, they must be set apart as men of ignominy &amp; baseness, as also for destruction. And when he had go<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ten all under his power, both the Command of treasure, dispose of all Offices aswell of power as others, did thereby rob the hearts of those that were conceived unbiaffable from righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115029:12"/>so far as for the present honor and favour of him (whose words and protestations touching righteousnesses not being able to be resisted) they thereby for zeale towards him forgot parents, children, kinssolke and acquaintance, not foreseeing the extreme vassillage that afterwads was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised by him upon those of their own loyns which they saw in great part Arbitrarily inflicted upon others and which might have been as preseden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to their own posterity, had not a present floating condition berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, as also because they felt it not, God opened not their hearts to prevent it, whose powerfull party he alwayes kept as ignorant as he could by transferring their actions to his supreme authority, and keeping of them in awe of it, and it in awe of them, and was zealous to amend many old abuses in State for pretence of Reformation, and yet would lay no foundation for a certaine Government, but seemingly would offer it; by which he was able to bring in whatsoeuer his sensuall desires coveted; through his mysterious policies (especially by easting a zealous prejudice amongst honest men touching Religion, and in which myst he brought in all Arbitrary cruelty, and caused them to be executioners thereof one against another with showting and much joy; he would say to no man thou shalt serve me, but contrive wayes to starve and destroy them that would not; and although he raigned thus for some time as absolute as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Emperor or Captaine Generall ever did, yet in the end after he had gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Pulpits, he took upon him the Title of Emperor also, but for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same was forced to omit committing Injustice by obstructing Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice but to fall upon such open Injustice and cruelty as no story mentions, nor yet of such a death as after the people inflicted upon him for the same, thus built he up for himselfe a great name of infamy, as that story at large will give you, all which may serve for a good warning to the best of men, above all, beware of prejudice that vaile of the mysterie; Try all things, Trust no man, Hold fast the best, but this is a hard thing to the sensuall man, nor can any doe it but Christians that delight not in fancies and bubbles of the flitting fauour of man, but in a holy inlarged heart of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse and communicative, happinesse according to the power of God in Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> The Citizens did also well consider that the grounds which are layd by war &amp; the Sword, must be maintained by the arme of flesh, &amp; rod of iron not reason; &amp; because the grounds and foundation of all buildings in State wil not fail greatly to ascertaine you of peace &amp; freedom, or war and slavery, which ever by grounds of war (as to slavery) will be so great as any wise Leader will please to have it, by casting the people under the prejudice of his Army; for ingratitude or the like, Therfore the Citizens being desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to give grounds for a peaceable Government of Christ, laid down your own things to have been proceeded in by a people of peace, out of Armes, conceiving your goodnesse would according to your duty oblige you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them; especially considering, as I must say againe, that what they there intended on your behalfe was so great as if you had the only Comand of England and Ireland too (maintaining propriety) you could not have more wayes of Greatnesse, Riches and Honor then is there laid downe,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115029:12"/>and by more certainty of holding the same then by a naked Conquest of the Sword: Only as also a sufficient competency of maintenance to the right worthy private souldiers for ever, as in the eight Article it appears; and for a ground to the performance thereof, a great person with you knows I enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to have brought sixty Gentlemen of the Common-Councell to him that would have satisfied him of the readinesse of the City touching the prosecution thereof, and for that it was grounded upon the old Truth and Law of the Nation would readily have been assented unto; And truly if at the first you might have had a million of soules to have set your agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on foot (under God) there had been little feare of as sodaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of the same: Gentlemen, my earnest desire is that we may not be deluded to the destruction of our selves &amp; nation by any misterious policies whatsoever, and that we may know where Christ goes, the Devil must vail; nor can a reall Christlike spirited man have any adversaries, especially when he commmeth into place of power to destribute impartiall Justice and judgment, which only is his nature; and that saying (Yea shall be hated of all men for my Name sake) is thus to be understood, First to cleer the matter of impossibility implyed in the word all; I conceive there is not a person that thinkes himselfe a Christian but knowes he hath some friends, but the words being spoken to the Disciples, who at first were to preach the Gospell distinct from one another abroad the world, there was an assurance in reason thàt at the beginning thereof it could not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, because they were to preach externall and internall peace and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome amongst a slaved people, that the greatest servitude and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Law was their most pure Religion to salvation, and at the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing thereof they could expect no other but destruction, particulary, &amp; it was spoken to them and no other.</p>
            <p>Therefore unlesse we bring the Scripture to an end, <hi>(viz)</hi> to admire the Father in his love, in sending such a Son, and patarne of righteousnesse, (moderation in the proper (sacred and holy) use of all things) we must poure torments of hell upon one another through the deceit of the beasts of the earth, through fancies of confusion, and think we shall do God service in it to; whereas our good and evill are both alike unto him that changeth not, the evil is unto us. And there is no such Antichrist, as they that have lain deepest in the sweet and meek spirit and love of Christ, who are able to speake his language to all, and (no question) are as civillized to all excesse, except that only one Honour, on which thousands of destructive evils unto others floateth in the large sea of hypocrisie and dissimulation, for accomplishment thereof. <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> should I remonstrate my reasons, that caused me (and ought for ever to cause me) so earnestly to contend for peace and freedom, (and truly I hope with an holy contention) I know you would not look upon me with a prejudiciall eye; because I hope you will not suffer your hearts to be stolen away through the favour of any, as the Courtiers did, but will consider your Fathers brethren, kindred and acquaintance, your children and posterity, and the whole Common-wealth; for which you have indured so much wearisome hardship and perils; and certainly as you have pulled up the foundation of Government, I hope you
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115029:13"/>will not delay any time, nor take any procrastinating Answer (through pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of a present unseasonableness in doing of it) to the immediate laying of another, nor suffer it to be any longer in a condition to be commanded &amp; governed by a rod of iron, of what weight of misery the commander thereof to the future will be pleased to put upon it, by casting the people under the prejudice of the Army, for ingratitude or other ways of division; The great dread whereof causeth me to offer you a second expedient, which certain if you cannot destroy my grounds of Reason, there is something of Reason worth the imbracing by you.</p>
            <p>That all the people of the particular Counties, of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> that have been faithfull to the Parliament, and against whom no just cause of exception appeareth, may have freedom to assemble together and chuse out 50 (to the best of their knowledge) of the most spotless men, as to excess, especially touching ambition and covetousness, (the cause of our miseries) and for avoiding revenge, prejudice, overbearing and byasing to particular interests, and against the generall good:) that are or shall not be Ministers, late or present Members of this Parliament, Lawyers, nor any Lords of Mannors, or other person worth less then 500 pounds at the least, that may draw up an agreement for the grounds foundation, and moddle of Government to the people of this Nation; which may be brought into the Parliament at a certain day, by a Committee of 10 at the fewest, appointed and chosen out of every Respective Committee of the the particular Counties; &amp; out of each of which there may be two appointed to draw up, and extract the major desires of every particular Comprised in every of the Agreements; And that then all people above the age of 18 yeers may be injoyned the subscribing thereof, or otherwise be put with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the protection of this Agreement and Lawes issuing thence.</p>
            <p>And truly Gentlemen, because I know the humility of the most of your hearts, and (though passing by much) cannot but mind you, that you may remember the Fields where your word was, <hi>God with us:</hi> as also neither you nor this City can forget at what time your <hi>Signall</hi> was a <hi>Laurell,</hi> and that it is provided for to the future you will finde them ingraven as sure badgeds of Conquest remembrances.</p>
